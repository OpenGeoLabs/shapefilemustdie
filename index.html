            Shapefile</a> is a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">file format for
            storing geospatial vector data</a>. It has been around since the early
    1990s and is still the most commonly used vector data exchange format.
    </p>
    <p>While Shapefiles have enabled many successful activities over the years, they also 
    have a number of limitations that complicate software development and reduce efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
    We, members of the geospatial IT industry, believe that it is time to stop using Shapefiles
    as the primary vector data exchange format and to replace them with a format that takes 
    advantage of the huge advances that have been made since Shapefile was introduced.

    <h2>The good side</h2>
    <p>
        Shapefile does a lot of things right. 
        Here are some reasons why Shapefile is so heavily used:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shapefile is by far the most widely supported format in existing software packages.</li>
        <li>While the format is proprietary, the 
          <a href="http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf">specification is open</a>.</li>
        <li>For many use cases, it is <em>good enough</em>.
          <ul>
            <li>Index files (e.g. *.shx) enable good reading performance.</li>
            <li>It is relatively efficient in terms of file size. The resulting file, even
                    un-zipped, is relatively small compared to some other (mostly
                    text-based) formats.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="alert-heading">Shapefile is a bad format</h2>

    <p>Why is Shapefile so bad? Here are several reasons why the Shapefile is a
    bad format and you should avoid its usage:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#nocrs">No coordinate reference system definition</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="#multifile">It's a multifile format</a>.</li>

        <li><a href="#255attributes">Only 255 attributes</a>. The DBF file does
                not allow you to store more then 255 attribute fields.</li>
        <li><a href="#datatypes">Limited data types</a>. Data types are limited
                to float, integer, date and text with a maximum 254
                characters.</li>
        <li><a href="#characterset">Unknown character set</a>. There is no way
                to specify the character set used in the database.</li>
        <li><a href="#sizelimit">It's limited to 2GB of file size</a>. Although some

    </div>

    <div class="alert alert" role="alert">
    <a name="nocrs"></a>
    <h3>No coordinate reference system definition</h3>
    <p>
       By default there is no definition of the coordinate reference system
       used. You can do it using e.g. <code>.prj</code>, but first: this is not
       standard part of the specification and second, there are still some
       issues, see <a href="projection">projection issues</a> and <a
                      href="multifile">multifile format</a> more lower.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="multifile"></a>
    <h3>Multifile format</h3>
    <p>
    The Shapefile format uses <a
       href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile#Overview">at least 3
       files</a> (*.shp, *.dbf, *.prj). Users cannot share just one file; you 
       must send them all. Users typically zip all the files into one archive
       and unzip them on the other end of the distribution chain, but this is 
       cumbersome and error-prone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, other geospatial software packages routinely add their own 
      extensions to try to overcome Shapefile limitations. Custom additions 
      are not supported by other tools and limit interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> 3rd December is considered the <em>International Shapefile day</em>,
    because thanks to modular, extensible architecture it can have 12+ sidecar files, 3 of which are mandatory.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="10characters"></a>
    <h3>10 Characters attribute names</h3>
    <p>
        Attribute names are limited to 10 characters max. Longer names
        are usually automatically shortened. This leads to abbreviated and/or 
        cryptic attribute names that are unintuitive to the recipient of the 
        data.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="255attributes"></a>
    <h3>255 attribute fields</h3>
    <p>
        There can be only 255 attribute fields in the database file. For some
        applications this is limiting, especially in combination with the <a
       href="#hierarchy">flat table structure</a>.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="datatypes"></a>
    <h3>Poor support for attribute data types</h3>
    <p>
        Float, integer, date and character string data types are supported. 
        Floating point numbers can be stored as text, but there is no support for big
        integers (thus the format is not usable, you have data with big
        integer identifiers, such as cadastral maps) and the text is limited to only
        254 characters.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no support for more advanced data fields such as blobs, images
		or arrays.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="characterset"></a>
    <h3>Unknown character set</h3>
    <p>
        There is no way to specify the character set used in the database. Many
        applications are using the old Windows-* or ISO-* data encodings,
        while nowadays we are tending to use UTF-8 more. Still there is no way to specify
        this in file header.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support for Unicode characters is also very limited.
    </p>
    </div>


    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="sizelimit"></a>
    <h3>2GB Size limit</h3>
    <p>
        The size of both .shp and .dbf component files cannot exceed 2 GB. <a
       href="http://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html">GDAL Shapefile driver</a>
        overcomes this limit, but
    </p>

        <blockquote><p>The Shapefile format explicitly uses 32bit offsets and so cannot go
        over 8GB (it actually uses 32bit offsets to 16bit words), but the OGR shapefile
        implementation has a limitation of 4GB.
                </p>
                <p>
        For compatibility with other software implementations, it is not recommended to use a file size over 2GB for both .SHP and .DBF files.
                </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>So 4GB is all you can have in single Shapefile. This sounds enough,
        but not for all cases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="simplefeature"></a>
    <h3>Non-topological format</h3>
    <p>
        Shapefile is simple-feature format. There is no way to store more
        complex geometry relationships.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="mixedgeometry"></a>
    <h3>No mixed geometry</h3>
    <p>
        Each file can be only one of the supported geometry formats (Point,
        Line, Polygon and others). Mixed geometry features are not possible.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="hierarchy"></a>
    <h3>Flat data structure</h3>
    <p>
        The data structure is limited to <em>flat</em> tables with no
        hierarchies, relations or tree structure.
    </p>
    </div>

	<div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="3d"></a>
    <h3>Very limited 3D support</h3>
    <p>
        Shapefile can't store material definitions nor textures (images
		with texture coordinates). 3D models are stored as a triangle or
		polygon soup, with no watertight models or parametric geometries
		being supported.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="projection"></a>
    <h3>Projection Definition Inconsistencies</h3>
    <p>
        By default, Shapefile contains no information about coordinate reference
        system at all. But some software packages do accept <code>*.prj</code>
        files, which may contain CRS description.
    </p>
    <p>
        It uses Esri WKT definitions, which are often incompatible
		with standard definitions in EPSG or other sources regarding aspects such
		as axis order or unit definitions. Furthermore, they often miss
		parameters required for reprojection ("Missing Bursa Wolf
		Parameters", anyone?)
    </p>
    </div>
	    
	    
    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="featuretype"></a>
    <h3>Multi part features has to be defined per-feature</h3>
    <p>
       Line and polygon geometry type, single or multipart, cannot be reliably 
	determined at the layer level, it must be determined at the 
	individual feature level. This leads to incositancy during automatic data processing, you can not relay on input geometry type and test each feature, whether it is single geometry or multiple geometries.

    <h2>Alternatives</h2>
    <img class="format-logo img-thumbnail" src="images/prefer-geopackage.png"/>
    <p>
    What are the alternatives to the Shapefile format? To be honest, no alternative
    format has overthrown the Shapefile hegemony yet. Some formats nearly
    took over (KML, GML, GeoJSON), but their usage was limited to relatively
    narrow use cases only.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although there are <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html">more then
            80 vector data formats in use</a> out there, only a few can be
    considered as candidates for Shapefile replacement. Please note, that we do
    take only <em>open</em> (preferably community) formats into account.

            </p>
            <p>
            The GeoPackage Encoding Standard describes a set of conventions for storing
            the following within an SQLite database:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>vector features</li>
                <li>tile matrix sets of imagery and raster maps at various scales</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
            There are several published <a href="http://www.geopackage.org/extensions.html">extensions</a>
            for GeoPackage which make this format even more powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
            GeoPackage is now (2017) <a href="https://twitter.com/pvangenuchten/status/914583535465435138">supported in most GIS software packages</a>.
            </p>
            <p>One downside to GeoPackage is that the underlying SQLite database
              is a complex binary format that is not suitable for streaming.
              It either must be written to the local file system or accessed
              through an intermediary service.
            </p>
            <p>We recommend GeoPackage as a Shapefile replacement for 
              scenarios where the recipient will want to query or edit the 
              data locally.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>GeoJSON is very simple, human-readable, text-based format. Although it
            is technically possible to use it with more coordinate reference
            systems, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-4">specification
                       states clearly</a>, that WGS84 is the only system, which
               should be used. It can handle complex vector data
            features and build complex hierarchical data models.
            </p>
            <p>Since GeoJSON is a JSON encoding it is very easy to parse.
            It also supports streaming (features are dealt with as they come in without waiting for the whole file to load).</p>
            <p>
            The problem with GeoJSON is that not all geometries can be represented and advanced coordinate reference systems are not well supported.</p>
            <p>We recommend GeoJSON as a Shapefile replacement for data interchange particularly for web services. For datasets with
              geometries or coordinate reference systems not representable in GeoJSON, GML may be suitable.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            GML was picked as the main distribution vector data format the European
            INSPIRE initiative. It's a very complex format, and its direct usage in
			GIS software is limited. Its main use is as a data exchange format that needs to be
			ingested into the user's system (e.g. into a database) to be fully usable.
            </p>
            <p>
            GML is currently often used for open data datasets, since it is 
            technology-neutral and a supported OGC Standard.
            </p>
            <p>A major downside to GML is that it is an <a href="http://erouault.blogspot.com/2014/04/gml-madness.html">insanely complex standard</a>.
              Few software packages support the entire standard and support for individual parts of the standard varies widely.</p>
            <p>
            We believe that GML is a candidate for Shapefile
            replacement for data interchange in situations where data is too complex to be represented by GeoJSON. 
            However, for the vast majority of datasets GML is overkill.

            is popular database, file based data storage.
            </p>

                    <li>File based</li>
                    <li>SQL database</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                SpatiaLite is an open source library intended to extend the SQLite core
                to support fully fledged Spatial SQL capabilities.
                SQLite is intrinsically simple and lightweight:
            </p>
            <ul>
                    <li>a single lightweight library implementing the full SQL engine</li>
                    <li>standard SQL implementation: almost complete SQL-92</li>
                    <li>a whole database simply corresponds to a single monolithic file
                            (no size limits)</li>
                    <li>any DB-file can be safely exchanged across different platforms,
                            because the internal architecture is universally
                            portable</li>
            </p>
            <p>
            Support for SpatiaLite is relatively limited and most software 
            that supports SpatiaLite also supports <a
               href="#geopackage">GeoPackage</a> as well. They build on top of
               the same underlying technology, SQLite.
            </p>
            SpatialLite lacks the support for extensions or raster data
            present in GeoPackage. While these are not necessarily must-have 
            features, they may be useful. Like GeoPackage, it is unsuitable
            for streaming.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since SpatiaLite offers no clear advantages over GeoPackage at 
            this time, it should only be considered as a Shapefile 
            replacement in niche scenarios.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            Among non-geospatial people, CSV is very popular, but for most
            geospatial applications it is not an ideal format.
            </p>
            <p>
            At least two reasons for not using CSV as Shapefile replacement: It isn't
            standardized (there are many dialects out there) and support for non-point
            geospatial data is complicated.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            KML was originally devised as the exchange format for a software package called
            Keyhole. When Google purchased Keyhole and released it as Google Earth, KML
            gained in popularity. However, as the geospatial community hit the limits of 
            both Google Earth and KML, KML's popularity has waned. Since it is XML based, it is not efficient 
            for storing larger datasets. It combines cartography along with the data geometry in one
            file, which is problematic when the data has the potential to be used in multiple
            ways. Since it officially supports only the WGS-84 coordinate reference system,
            it is not suitable for a number of applications.

            <p>
            GeoDatabase is very often used in the ArcGIS environment as the main

            </p>
            <p>
            On the other hand, since it is a proprietary closed format, implementations 
            outside the environment of ESRI products are extremely limited. It is only a 
            candidate for replacing Shapefiles in an enviroment centered on ArcGIS.
