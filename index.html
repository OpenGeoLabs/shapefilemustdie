            Shapefile</a> is a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">file format for
            storing geospatial vector data</a>. It has been around since the early
    1990s. It is still used as most common exchange vector data format.
    </p>
    <p>The geospatial IT industry made a huge step since then, yet the Shapefile
    is still most common file format for sharing vector data.
    </p>
    <p>
    Shapefile was a great format in it's time and the fact, that it's still used
    today proofs, that it's design was truly eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yet we believe, that the time of the Shapefile has passed and we, the Geospatial
    IT Industry, shall replace it with more modern concepts. Shapefile is now an
    outdated format and should be abandoned in the future for sharing of
    geospatial vector data.

    <h2>The good side</h2>
    <p>
        Not all Shapefile features do make it a bad (or unmodern) format. There is
        a couple of reasons why Shapefile still beats most other
        formats:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Even though proprietary, the specification is open and
                implemented everywhere.</li>
        <li>Shapefile is by far the most supported format. If every other format
                fails, Shapefile is always supported</li>
        <li>For most of the usecases, it appears to be <em>good enough</em>.</li>
		<li>Index files (e.g. *.shx) enable good reading performance.</li>
        <li>It appears to be relatively efficient - the resulting file, even
                un-zipped - is relatively small, compared to some other, mostly
                text-based formats.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="alert-heading">Shapefile is a bad format</h2>

    <p>Why is Shapefile so bad? Here are several reasons why the Shapefile is a
    bad format and you should avoid it's usage:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#multifile">It's a multifile format</a>. You can not
                share just one file, you always need to send at least 3
				(*.shp, *.dbf, *.prj), or zip them together, which makes
				sharing error-prone</li>
        <li><a href="#10characters">Attribute names are limited to 10
                characters</a>. If you need longer attribute names, you
                are lost.</li>
        <li><a href="#255attributes">Only 255 attributes</a>. The DBF file does
                not allow to store more then 255 attribute fields.</li>
        <li><a href="#datatypes">Limitted data types</a>. Data types are limited
                to float, integer, date and text with maximum 254
                characters.</li>
        <li><a href="#characterset">Unknown character set</a>. There is no way
                how to specify character set used in the database.</li>
        <li><a href="#sizelimit">It's limited to 2GB of file size</a>. Even some
                tools are able to overpass this limit, they can never exceed 4GB
                of data.</li>
        <li><a href="#simplefeature">No topology in the data</a>. There is no
                way, how to describe topological relations in the format.</li>
        <li><a href="#mixedgeometry">Single geometry type per file</a>. There is
                no way, how to save mixed geometry features.</li>
        <li><a href="#hierarchy">More complicated data structures are impossible
                to save</a>. It's "flat table" format.</li>
        <li><a href="#3d">There is no way to store 3D data with textures or
				appearances such as material definitions.</a> There is also no way
				to store solids or parametric objects.</li>
		<li><a href="#projection">Projections defined in the *.prj file are

    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="multifile"></a>
    <h3>Multifile format</h3>
    <p>
    The Shapefile uses <a
       href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile#Overview">at least 3
       files</a>, but there are up to 10 other file extensions, which can be
       distributed along with the Shapefile. Nearly every geospatial software
       package is adding it's own extension to try to overcome some of the
       limit's Shapefile has.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is highly unpractical for distribution of the data. Users usually
        have to zip all the files into one archive - and unzip it on the other
        end of the distribution chain. Custom additions are not supported by
		other tools and limit interoperability.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="10characters"></a>
    <h3>10 Characters attribute names</h3>
    <p>
        Attribute names are limited to 10 characters at maximum. Longer names
        are usually automatically shortened. This is limiting to some applications
        and leads to bad data arrangement.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="255attributes"></a>
    <h3>255 attribute fields</h3>
    <p>
        There can be only 255 attribute fields in the database file. For some
        applications, this is limiting especially in combination with the <a
       href="#hierarchy">flat table structure</a>.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="datatypes"></a>
    <h3>Poor support for attribute data types</h3>
    <p>
        Float, integer, date and character string data types are supported. But
        floating point numbers are stored as text, there is no support for big
        integers (thus the format is not usable, you are having data with big
        integer identifiers, such as cadastral map) and the text is limited to
        254 characters only.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no support for more advanced data fields such as blobs, images
		or arrays.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="characterset"></a>
    <h3>Unknown character set</h3>
    <p>
        There is no way how to specify character set used in the database. Most
        of the applications are using the old Windows-* or ISO-* data encodings,
        but nowadays, we are using UTF-8. Still there is no way how to specify
        this in file header.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support for Unicode characters is also very limited.
    </p>
    </div>


    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="sizelimit"></a>
    <h3>2GB Size limit</h3>
    <p>
        The size of both .shp and .dbf component files cannot exceed 2 GB. <a
       href="http://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html">GDAL Shapefile driver</a>
        overcomes this limit, but
    </p>

        <blockquote><p>The Shapefile format explicitly uses 32bit offsets and so cannot go
        over 8GB (it actually uses 32bit offsets to 16bit words), but the OGR shapefile
        implementation has a limitation to 4GB.
                </p>
                <p>
        However, for compatibility with other software implementation, it is not recommended to use a file size over 2GB for both .SHP and .DBF files.
                </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>So 4GB is all you can have in single Shapefile. This sounds enough,
        but not for all cases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="simplefeature"></a>
    <h3>Non-topological format</h3>
    <p>
        Shapefile is simple-feature format. There is no way to store more
        complex geometry relationships.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="mixedgeometry"></a>
    <h3>No mixed geometry</h3>
    <p>
        Each file can be only one of the supported geometry formats (Point,
        Line, Polygon and others). Mixed geometry features are not possible.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="hierarchy"></a>
    <h3>Flat data structure</h3>
    <p>
        The data structure is limited to <em>flat</em> tables with no
        hierarchies, relations or tree structure.
    </p>
    </div>

	<div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="3d"></a>
    <h3>Very limited 3D support</h3>
    <p>
        Shapefile can't store material definitions nor textures (images
		with texture coordinates). 3D models are stored as a triangle or
		polygon soup, with no watertight models or parametric geometries
		being supported.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="projection"></a>
    <h3>Projection Definition Inconsistencies</h3>
    <p>
        Shapefiles use Esri WKT definitions, which are often incompatible
		with standard definitions in EPSG or other sources on aspects such
		as axis order or unit definitions. Furthermore, they often miss
		parameters required for reprojection ("Missing Bursa Wolf
		Parameters", anyone?)

    <h2>Alternatives</h2>
    <img class="format-logo img-thumbnail" src="images/prefer-geopackage.png"/>
    <p>
    What are the alternatives for the Shapefile? To be honest, no alternative
    format did take over Shapefiles hegemony yet. Some of the formats nearly
    took over (KML, GML, GeoJSON), but their usage was limited for relatively
    narrow use cases only.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although there are <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html">more then
            80 used vector data formats</a> out there, only few can be
    considered as the candidate for Shapefile replacement.

            <p>
            GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable,
            self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information.
            </p>
            <p>
            The GeoPackage Encoding Standard describes a set of conventions for storing
            the following within an SQLite database:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>vector features</li>
                <li>tile matrix sets of imagery and raster maps at various scales</li>

            for GeoPackage, who make this format even more powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
            GeoPackage is now (2017) <a href="https://twitter.com/pvangenuchten/status/914583535465435138">supported in most of the software packages</a>.

            </ul>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>GeoJSON is very simple, human-readable, text-based format. Although it
            was design to support WGS-84 only, it's possible to use it for other
            coordinate reference systems too. It can handle complex vector data
            features and build complex hierarchical data models.
            </p>
            <p>Since GeoJSON is based on JSON it is very easy to parse, additonally it can be streamed where features are dealt with as they come in without waiting for the whole file to load.</p>
            <p>
            The problem with GeoJSON is that not all geometries can be represented and advanced coordiante reference systems are not well supported.</p>
            <p>We recomend GeoJSON as a Shapefile replacement for most data interchange. Datasets that <strong>must</strong> be tranfered in a non WGS-84 coordinate reference system or have geometry not representable in GeoJSON can use GML but for the vast majority of datasets GML is overkill.

            </ul>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            GML was picked as the main distribution vector data format the European
            INSPIRE initiative. It's a very complex format, and it's direct usage in
			GIS software is limited. It's main use is as a data exchange format that needs to be
			ingested into the user's system (e.g. into a database) to be fully useable.
            </p>
            <p>
            GML is currently often used for open data data sets, since it's technology
            neutral and supported OGC Standard.
            </p>
            <p>A major downside to GML is that it is an <a href="http://erouault.blogspot.com/2014/04/gml-madness.html">insanely complex standard</a>, few pieces of software support all parts of the standard, and different pieces of software sometimes suport different parts of the standard.</p>
            <p>
            We believe, what GML is a candidate for Shapefile
            replacement for data interchange in situations where data is too copmlex to be represented by GeoJSON.

            is popular database, file based data storage.

            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                    <li>File based</li>
                    <li>SQL database</li>
                    <li>OGC Simple feature</li>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                SpatiaLite is an open source library intended to extend the SQLite core
                to support fully fledged Spatial SQL capabilities.
                SQLite is intrinsically simple and lightweight:
            </p>
            <ul>
                    <li>a single lightweight library implementing the full SQL engine</li>
                    <li>standard SQL implementation: almost complete SQL-92</li>
                    <li>a whole database simply corresponds to a single monolithic file
                            (no size limits)</li>
                    <li>any DB-file can be safely exchanged across different platforms,
                            because the internal architecture is universally
                            portable</li>
            </p>
            <p>
            To us, SpatiaLite seems to be the second best option after the <a
               href="#geopackage">GeoPackage</a> possibility. They do build on top of
               the same technology, which is SQLite.
            </p>
            <p>
            Compared to GeoPackage, it lacks support for extensions and support for
            raster data - that is certainly not a must-have feature, but it's good, if
            we take this into consideration. Like GeoPackage it suffers the same issues inherint to SQLite that make it a poor choice for data interchange.

            Some people tend to use <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt">comma

                <li>Simple</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            Among non-GeoSpatial people, CSV is very popular, but for most of
            GeoSpatial applications it's unusable format.
            </p>
            <p>
            At least two reasons for not using CSV as Shapefile replacement: It's not
            standardized (there are many dialects out there), and support for non-point
            geospatial data is complicated.

                    <li>Supports just WGS-84 coordinate system</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            Some years back, the KML format was very popular, but the geospatial
            community hit on its limits. Since XML based, it's not suitable for bigger
            datasets. It combines cartography along with the data geometry in one
            file, which does not seem to be good solution. And it officially supports
            only WGS-84 coordinate reference system.

            <p class="lead">
            At its most basic level, an <a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/geodatabases/what-is-a-geodatabase.htm">ArcGIS geodatabase</a> is a collection of geographic
            datasets of various types held in a common file system folder, a Microsoft
            Access database, or a multiuser relational DBMS (such as Oracle, Microsoft
            SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Informix, or IBM DB2).
            </p>
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                    <li>native data structure for ArcGIS</li>
                    <li>file-based (or database based)</li>
                    <li>complex data models</li>
                    <li>proprietary, closed format</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            GeoDatabase is very often used in the ArcGIS environment as the main
            exchange data format. It's features are very complex and advanced.
            </p>
            <p>
            On the other hand, it's proprietary closed format, which is used exclusively
            in the environment of ESRI products, not implemented in other software
            packages.  It's a strong candidate replacing Shapefiles for local data editing in an ArcGIS enviroment.
